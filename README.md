# Optimizing Bus Route Efficiency using Real-Time Passenger Density Prediction

**Overview:**

This project focuses on optimizing public bus route efficiency by leveraging real-time passenger density prediction.  The analysis utilizes historical passenger data (assumed to be provided in a suitable format) to build a predictive model. This model then forecasts passenger density at various stops and times, enabling dynamic adjustments to bus schedules to better match demand, ultimately reducing operational costs and improving service for passengers.  The project employs machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions and data visualization to effectively communicate findings.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn (for model building)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn (for data visualization)

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary Python libraries listed above using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script:** After installing the dependencies, execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You will need to provide the necessary input data files as specified within the `main.py` script.  The exact location and format of these data files are detailed in the `data` directory (if applicable).


**Example Output:**

The script will output the following:

* **Console Output:**  A summary of the analysis, including key performance indicators (KPIs) of the predictive model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  Specific details regarding predicted passenger densities at different bus stops and times will also be printed.
* **Plot Files:**  The script will generate visualization plots (e.g., passenger density trends over time, predicted vs. actual passenger counts) and save them in the `output` directory.  These plots provide a visual representation of the model's performance and the predicted passenger density patterns.  (e.g., `passenger_density_predictions.png`, `model_performance.png`).


**Further Development:**

Future work could involve exploring more advanced machine learning models, integrating real-time data feeds from GPS trackers and passenger counters, and developing a system for dynamically adjusting bus schedules based on the predictions.
